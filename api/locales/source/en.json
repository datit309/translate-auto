    "SWAP_SHEN": "When you begin trading, you'll notice that you're given a 'bid' (or 'sell') price and an 'ask' (or 'buy') price. The 'bid' is the price at which you sell the base currency, and the 'ask' is the price at which you buy the base currency. The difference between these two prices is what we call the spre' ad. When a trade is opened, there are always third parties who facilitate the opening and closing of that trade, like a bank or a liquidity provider. These third parties must make sure that there is an orderly flow of buy and sell orders, which means that they have to find a buyer for every seller and vice versa. The third party is accepting the risk of a loss while facilitating the trade, thus the reason the third party will retain a part of each trade – that retained part is called the spread!",
    "SWAP_SPREAD": "The spread itself is measured in 'pips', which is the smallest unit of price movement of a currency pair. So, the spread in the below example is 0.2 Pips.",
    "SWAP_COST": "HOW DO YOU CALCULATE YOUR TRANSACTION COST?",
    "SWAP_TO": "To work out the cost of a trade itself (not including swaps, commissions etc.), you take the spread and pip value and multiply it by the number of lots that you're trading: Trade Cost = Spread X Trade Size X Pip Value",
    "SWAP_FOR": "For example:",
    "SWAP_A": "A trade you have opened has 1.2 pips spread. In this example, you're trading with mini lots which are 10,000 base units. The pip value is at , so the transaction cost is .20 As you've probably gathered, the bigger the trade, the larger your transaction costs will be!",
    "SWAP_SWAPS": "WHAT ARE SWAPS?",
    "SWAP_QUITE": "Quite simply, swaps are an overnight interest charge that traders must pay to hold a position open overnight. When a trader wants to keep a position open, they will pay interest on the currency sold, and receive interest on the currency bought. So, the swaps are derived from the interest rates of the countries involved in the currency pair, whether the trader is going long or short and the current market conditions.",
    "SWAP_IMPORTANT": "IMPORTANT SWAP/ROLLOVER RATE FACTS",
    "SWAP_RATES": "Swap rates are applied at 00:00 platform time. Each currency pair has its own swap charge and is measured on a standard size of 1 lot (100,000 base units). Swaps are applied each night onto your open positions and when the position is left open it is given a new 'value date'. On Wednesday night however, the new value date for a trade held open is changed to Monday. Due to this, swaps are charged at triple the rate. Check your swaps on your MT5 Market Watch panel. You simply right click, select 'symbols', select the instrument and then select 'Properties'.",

    "LEVERAGE_TITLE": "THE USE OF LEVERAGE & MARGIN",
    "LEVERAGE_ONE": "One of the main appealing factors about forex trading is the use of Leverage & Margin. It allows you to use a small amount of capital to open and maintain a much larger position. For example, if you want to open a trade of 0,000 worth of EURUSD, you don't have to have that 0,000 dollars in your account!",
    "LEVERAGE_WHAT": "WHAT IS MARGIN?",
    "LEVERAGE_TECH": "Technically, leverage is where a trader has a large sum at their disposal while using a significantly smaller amount of their own funds. They effectively borrow the rest from their broker.",
    "LEVERAGE_FOR": "For example, if you're trading with a 1:100 leverage, and you have ,000 USD in your account, you've got 0,000 available for trading. Although this sounds like an insanely good opportunity, you must always remember that it's a double-edged sword.",
    "LEVERAGE_WHEN": "When you trade with a larger amount, as leverage enables you to do, you can open bigger positions and potentially earn larger profits. However, with bigger positions you also have a higher risk whereby your losses could also be larger.",
    "LEVERAGE_IT": "It may be easier to understand if you think of the margin as a deposit for the trade that you want to open and maintain. The broker that you're trading with will keep a portion of your balance to cover the potential loss of that trade. Once you close the position, the margin will be put back into your account.",
    "LEVERAGE_THE": "The margin that you need for a trade is normally expressed as a percentage of the whole trade and is called the 'Margin requirement'. You'll be given a margin requirement for every trade that you open, and it will vary depending on the instrument that you trade and the broker that you choose to trade with.",
    "LEVERAGE_HOW": "HOW DO YOU CALCULATE THE MARGIN REQUIREMENT?",
    "LEVERAGE_WELL": "Well, the required margin will be a percentage of the size of the trade that you want to open and is calculated according to the base currency of the pair that you want to trade. Using the equation below you can work out how much margin you'll need for each trade.",
    "LEVERAGE_REQUIRE": "Required Margin = Position Size X Margin Requirement",
    "LEVERAGE_EX": "For example:",
    "LEVERAGE_YOU": "You'd like to open a mini lot (10,000 base units) in USDJPY. How much margin do you need to open the position?",
